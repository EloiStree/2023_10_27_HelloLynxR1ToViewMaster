# 2023 10 27: HelloLynxR1ToViewMaster

My first project with Lynx is with Luxxo to make a view master and a unfolding of the Lynx :)
Then I tried on it to add a tribute to Ganja music.
As it is a simple "hello world" this project id discontinued. 
It was just there to experiment.

Feel free to check the code if you see something you like in the video:
